## Remarks

RAM cost: 0 GB

Opens a script’s logs. This is functionally the same as the tail Terminal command.

If the function is called with no arguments, it will open the current script’s logs.

Otherwise, the fn, hostname/ip, and args… arguments can be used to get the logs from another script. Remember that scripts are uniquely identified by both their names and arguments.

## Example 1

```ts
//Open logs from foo.script on the current server that was run with no args
tail("foo.script");
```

## Example 2

```ts
//Get logs from foo.script on the foodnstuff server that was run with no args
tail("foo.script", "foodnstuff");
```

## Example 3

```ts
//Get logs from foo.script on the foodnstuff server that was run with the arguments [1, "test"]
tail("foo.script", "foodnstuff", 1, "test");
```
